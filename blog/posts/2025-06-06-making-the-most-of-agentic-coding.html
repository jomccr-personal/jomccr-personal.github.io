      <h2 style="text-align: left">What to expect.</h2>
      <p>
        You've probably been there: excitedly asking ChatGPT to "just build
        this feature" only to watch it confidently generate code that doesn't
        compile, uses deprecated APIs, or solves the wrong problem entirely.
        The frustration is real.
      </p>
      <p>
        Asking the agent to migrate your core Django app built over 10 years
        ago to Node.js and React might be more than it can do in one shot.
        This is when most people give up and write their LinkedIn post about
        the AI hype bubble. Agents are just as good at question and answer
        over large codebases as they are at solving leetcode. So take it a
        step further: ask the agent to come up with three different plans of
        attack for your problem or feature. You will benefit more from using
        agents if you let them do some discovery and planning before writing
        code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coincidentally this is the same process any engineer should take when
        starting on a feature.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Use custom instructions&nbsp;</h2>
      <p>
        Some examples include AGENTS.md, CLAUDE.md, and
        .github/copilot-instructions.md. Check your editor or agent
        documentation for details.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        These are used to inject important context at the start of every
        conversation (or sometimes every request). I suggest adding to your
        prompt files something small and light:
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Project workflow</b>: make change → run "make compile" → run "make
        test" → run "make test-integration" → all tests must pass
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tech debt rules</b>: docs live in docs2/... not docs/..., always
        run ./login sh before ./start.sh
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Git workflow</b>: use the "gh" command to open prs and inspect
        GitHub actions with "gh run view", etc
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Tightening the feedback loop</h2>
      <p>
        One of the best things that you can do to make your agentic coding
        more productive also turns out to be super nice to have in general:
        tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thankfully LLMs are pretty good at writing unit tests and they help
        tighten the feedback loop a lot.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        Speeding up and resolving flakey tests is a really good best practice
        and will help you and your agent build the confidence needed to trust
        the changes it's making.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Context management and memory</h2>
      <p>
        Agents don't have perfect memory across long sessions. Break complex
        tasks into smaller, focused conversations or use project-specific
        documentation to maintain context. Consider creating a "working notes"
        file that the agent can reference and update as it progresses through
        multi-step tasks.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Version control best practices</h2>
      <p>
        Commit frequently when working with agents. Create checkpoint commits
        before major changes so you can easily revert if the agent goes off
        track. Use descriptive commit messages that indicate AI-assisted work
        for future reference.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Hint</b>: add this to your custom system prompt: "commit after
        every major change is complete, do not push"
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Know when to intervene</h2>
      <p>
        Learn to recognize when an agent is stuck in a loop or making the same
        mistake repeatedly. Sometimes a small human nudge or clarification can
        get things back on track faster than letting it struggle. Don't be
        afraid to course-correct or take manual control when needed.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Leverage the agent's strengths</h2>
      <p>
        Agents excel at boilerplate generation, test writing, documentation,
        code analysis, and explaining unfamiliar codebases. Use them for these
        tasks while keeping the high-level architecture decisions and complex
        business logic to yourself.
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">Set up your environment for success</h2>
      <p>
        Ensure your development environment has good error messages, fast test
        suites, and clear build processes. The easier it is for the agent to
        understand what went wrong, the faster it can course-correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your project is using a semi obscure or newer library, download the
        relevant docs in a subfolder that it can access or configure an MCP
        server to give it the tools necessary to look up the docs. This helps
        eliminate hallucinations of non-existent methods and function
        args.&nbsp;
      </p>
      <h2 style="text-align: left">TLDR</h2>
      <p>
        <b>Calibrate expectations</b>: Treat agents like junior developers who
        need clear guidance and planning - helps avoid frustration when
        complex tasks fail
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Custom instructions</b>: Inject project-specific workflows and
        rules upfront - saves time correcting the same mistakes repeatedly
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Tighten feedback loops</b>: Invest in good tests and fast builds -
        gives agents (and you) confidence to make changes quickly
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Manage context</b>: Break big tasks into focused sessions with
        documentation - prevents agents from losing track of progress
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Version control discipline</b>: Commit frequently with descriptive
        messages - makes it easy to backtrack when things go sideways
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Know when to intervene</b>: Recognize when agents are stuck in
        loops - prevents wasted time on repetitive failures
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Play to strengths</b>: Use agents for boilerplate, tests, and
        analysis while keeping architecture decisions human - maximizes
        productivity for both
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Environment setup</b>: Ensure clear error messages and fast
        feedback - helps agents self-correct instead of flailing
