        With the advent of agentic coding assistants like VS Code's <a
          href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/copilot/chat/chat-agent-mode">agent mode</a>, totally new IDEs like
        <a href="https://www.cursor.com">Cursor</a>, and my personal favorite: the minimalist <a
          href="https://www.anthropic.com/claude-code">Claude code</a> - some software developers have been left
        scratching their heads trying to figure out what exactly these new assistants are good at. This article will
        discuss three things to look out for and how to fix them to get the most out of building with agents. The main
        piece of advice has been the laughing stock of many tech jokes on the internet. I've included the obligatory <a
          href="https://xkcd.com/1319/">relevant xkcd</a> below.
      </p>

      <figure style="text-align: center; margin: 2em 0;">
        <img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/automation.png" alt="XKCD 1319, 'Automation'"
          style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;">
        <figcaption>XKCD 1319, "Automation"</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        The truth is that this used to be true. Writing throwaway software was a <em>luxury</em>, something that rarely
        was done because the process was often many times more complicated than just doing the task and getting on with
        your life. Only the most major annoyances got the special treatment of automation at the behest of product
        management. Often each developer would build their own half-baked smattering of bash scripts and unholy makefile
        targets combined together into a lovecraftian monster that nobody fully understood.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, after the introduction of agents, this all changed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throwaway code is now cheaper than ever to write (or generate). Often it can be done in a single prompt. What
        used to take a week to build properly now takes hours to get off the ground. This rapid development cycle for
        small developer experience focused utilities is the most underrated tool for increasing your productivity when
        working with agents.. If there is a manual interaction with something on the web, especially if it already has
        an existing API, you should consider building a command line tool that an agent can use for interacting with it
        if it doesn't exist already. The biggest boost from getting to use an agent vs a traditional chat-only LLM is,
        well, the <strong>agency</strong> that it has to call tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        Take this <a
          href="https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices#2-give-claude-more-tools">example from
          Anthropic</a> about the already popular <code>gh</code> command:
      </p>

      <blockquote style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-left: 4px solid #1a73e8; margin: 1.5em 0;">
        Claude knows how to use the gh CLI to interact with GitHub for creating issues, opening pull requests,
        reading comments, and more. Without gh installed, Claude can still use the GitHub API or MCP server (if you
        have it installed).
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        You should be thinking about how to build the <code>gh</code> for your team or service. Building niche tools for
        your agents can be very rewarding. I think it will turn out to be some of the most productive work that we are
        all totally skipping today. There will be a suite of these kinds of tools, simple bash tools for interacting
        with common services, that bubble to the top. Different workflows require different tools, and for my data
        engineering day job I've built <a href="https://pypi.org/project/afcli"><code>afcli</code></a> to make it easier
        to interact with development servers that you've stood up during development.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left">Why not use the existing airflow CLI?</h2>

      <p>
        It's niche enough that nobody has built it. The main feature that I had thought was missing from the
        <code>airflow</code> CLI was the <code>--host</code> functionality. I wanted a way to point to a running airflow
        host and skip having to find the docker container id, then run docker exec with the proper airflow command, etc.
        All of this indirection adds potential edge cases for the agent loop to break down. There is also no need for
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left">The legacy workflow</h2>

      <p>
        Before agents, developers could mount their code in a docker volume that would update regularly. The flow was:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Write code</li>
        <li>Import error</li>
        <li>Fix code</li>
        <li>Trigger dag</li>
        <li>Task failed</li>
        <li>Fix code</li>
        <li>Clear tasks</li>
        <li>Finally watch logs succeed</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This iteration loop was completely broken. Imagine a random slack huddle pop up throwing you out of the zone in
        the middle of this loop. Experienced developers have consistently noted that <a
          href="https://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">context switching</a> is the number one killer of your
        productivity. The context switch between your agent and your system that you're working on is just as expensive.
      </p>

      <h2 style="text-align: left">Practical example with afcli</h2>

      <p>
        In your <a href="http://CLAUDE.md">CLAUDE.md</a> or equivalent, you'll want to add something like this:
      </p>
      <pre style="background: #f8f9fa; padding: 15px; border-radius: 5px; overflow-x: auto;"><code>When building with airflow, check the dag and task level statuses with `afcli`.
Use `afcli` for fetching logs and to validate your changes.
After making a change, run `afcli` to kick off the dag or task that you're working on and iterate until every task succeeds.
Run `afcli --help` to understand common usage patterns and specific CLI options.</code>
      </pre>

      <p style="text-align: left">This may seem simple, but it's insanely effective. Giving your agent the instructions
        on how to iterate faster unlocks a tight loop that will let you turn features around faster than ever.</p>
